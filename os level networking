configuring ip
using ifconfig 
we can maintain permanent ip address by giving manual in the host application-settings-netwok-ip4
changing hostname by
hostnamectl set-hostname server1
bash
taking remote session using ssh. 
ssh oracle@192.168.1.200-----changing to server 2 from server1
ssh oracle@192.168.1.100-----changing to server 1 from server2

we can keep host name without using ip address everytime
vi /etc/hosts
192.168.1.100 server1.com server1 srv1
192.168.1.200 server2.com server2 srv2

esc
:x

then we can directly connect to other server ssh oracle@server1
it will ask for pswd -oracle then we are moved to other server
to overcome this not give pswd;
cd 
cd .ssh
ls -lrt
ssh-keygen
ls -lrt
ssh-copy-id oracle@server2
pswd-oracle
now we can connect directly without pswd from server1 to server2 




to copy a file from one server to other server:


We have created the file in database as file using cat > file1 this first file
to copy this into server 2 we have 
scp file1 oracle@server2:/u01/file1
