After connecting to database in sql mode:
select group#,STATUS ,MEMBERS,bytes/1024/1024 MB from v$log;

    GROUP# STATUS	       MEMBERS	       MB
---------- ---------------- ---------- ----------
	 1 INACTIVE		     2	      200
	 2 CURRENT		     2	      200
	 3 INACTIVE		     2	      200
we will get the above result which shows the status group number and members

we can switch the logfile using the commad:
alter system switch logfile;

mkdir -p /u01/duplex/ 
//creating the new directory where we are going to add new log files.

we can add the members in the group by using the command:
alter database add logfile member '/u01/duplex/redolog1_3' to group 1;

to add group
alter database add logfile group4 'path'

alter database drop logfile member '/u01/diplex/redplog1_3';
we can remove the logfile.
